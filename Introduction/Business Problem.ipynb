            "source": "Fashion has become synonymous with geographic locations, sometimes referred to as fashion capitals. Historically in Europe the earliest centres of fashion were defined through the royal courts with the reigning monarch or high nobility dictating the accepted dress styles and protocols of the day. Status and displays of wealth were central to early expressions of what passed for fashion, while sumptuary laws I maintained and reinforced social distinctions.\n\nFashion design operates as part of a structured, international fashion industry. Industrial and technological advances have directly contributed to increasingly efficlent supply chains, with each business fulfilling a price category to serve a fashion retail segment. In the fashion industry, the method of production usually provides an early indicator to the type of business and target market. When conceptualized as a hierarchical model, the fashion industry can be viewed as follows:\n1. Couture (haute couture): unique designs made to couture standards from leading names including Chanel and Chratian Dior;\n2. Designer: top designer ready to wear lines, such as Dries Van Notan and Prada;\n3. Bridge or diffusion: more moderately priced lines, such as Marc Jocobs and DKNY;\n4. Upper high street: good-quality branded labels and private labels sold through a variety of chains and retail outlet labels, including Karen Millen and Jones New York;\n5. Mid-high street: contemporary and private labels with competitively priced fash on-forward merchandise, such as Gap and Next;\n6. Lower high street: volume selling merchandise that is moderately priced and might include adaptations of higher priced merchandise catagories,such as H&M and New Look;\n7. Budget: mass produced goods at very affordable price points, such as Primark and Cherokee.\n\nThis model should be considered when selecting the most suitable locations for the new stores as the areas depend on the target audience."

            "source": "A fashion retailer decided to open a new store in Paris, France, and needs to do some research to make data-driven decisions on the new locations that are most suitable for their new store.\n\nThe fashion retailer is positioned as the lower high street brand label. As such, they do not seek stores in the premium upmarket strips like Avenue Montaigne, but rather, in high traffic areas where consumers go for shopping, restaurants and entertainment. The best locations to open new fashion retail stores may not only be where other clothing stores are grouped. While it is always good to have some other fashion stores in the area, it is strongly suggested that the best places are in fact areas that have an abundance of French Restaurants, Caf\u00e9s and Wine Bars. Parisians are very social and tend to frequent these places often, so opening new stores in these locations is becoming popular, especially if the stores offer something experiential.\n\nThe analysis and recommendations for new store locations will focus on general districts with these establishments, not on specific store addresses. Narrowing down the best district options derived from analysis allows for either further research to be conducted, advising agents of the chosen neighbourhood, or on the ground searching for specific sites by the company\u2019s personnel."
